## Introduction

The `liveregr` package allows for the analysis of the Irish CSO (Central Statistics Office)
Live Register unemployment data. The functionality of the package includes:

* Loading the Live Register dataset.
* Filter the loaded dataset.
* Fit various Spline models to the dataset.
* Plot the dataset and fitted Spline model.
* Summarise the dataset and fitted Spline model.

A Shiny application also forms part of the `liveregr` package and allows the user to exercise
the functionality of the package.

## Loading the Data

The `load_livereg()` function loads the Irish CSO Live Register unemployment data. The data
can either be loaded from the CSO StatBank API or a static JSON file included in the 
`liveregr` package (offline mode). The data loaded can either be the raw unemployment
number or the seasonally adjusted unemployment number. The returned object from 
`load_livereg()` is a `livereg` object with the following information:

* Boolean __`seasonally.adjusted`__ field.
* A __`data`__ field which is a `data.frame` containing the following information:

    - Unemployment numbers for all gender/age group combinations.
    - __`time_points`__ contains the time point for each unemployment number as a `Date`.
    - __`year`__ year of the time point.
    - __`mon`__ month of the time point as an integer.
    - __`month`__ month of the time point as a factor.

Offline mode is controlled by setting the `use.offline.data` input parameter to TRUE. Loading
seasonally adjusted data is controlled by setting the `seasonally.adj` input parameter.

#### Load Seasonally Adjusted Unemployment Data in Offline Mode

```{r}
# Load the data
dat = load_livereg(seasonally.adj = TRUE, use.offline.data = TRUE)

# High level summary
summary(dat)

# Fields in the "data" data.frame
colnames(dat$data)
```

#### Load Raw Unemployment Data in Offline Mode

```{r}
# Load the data
dat = load_livereg(seasonally.adj = FALSE, use.offline.data = TRUE)

# High level summary
summary(dat)

# Fields in the "data" data.frame
colnames(dat$data)
```

## Filtering the Data

The `filter()` function will filter the `livereg` data object. The filtering input parameters
are:

* __`start.year`__ the first year of the unemployment data.
* __`end.year`__ the end year of the unemployment data.
* __`gender`__ a vector of gender strings. Choices are: "female", "male", "both".
* __`age.group`__ a vector of age group strings. Choices are: "all", "under_25", "over_and_25".

The data object returned from the `filter()` function is a `livereg` data object with all fields
filtered based on the input parameters.

#### Filter the data by start and end year

```{r}
# Filter the data so that we only have data from 2010 to 2018
filtered_by_years_dat = filter(dat, start.year = 2010, end.year = 2018)

# Notice that we still have all the gender and age group combinations
colnames(filtered_by_years_dat$data)

# However the data for these data points only runs from 2010 to 2018
range(filtered_by_years_dat$data$year)
```

#### Filter the data by gender

```{r}
# Filter the data so that we only have female data
filtered_by_gender_dat = filter(dat, gender = c("female"))

# Notice that we have data points for females across all age groups
colnames(filtered_by_gender_dat$data)
```

#### Filter the data by age group

```{r}
# Filter the data so that we only have female data
filtered_by_age_dat = filter(dat, age.group = c("all"))

# Notice that we have data points for the "all" age group across all genders
colnames(filtered_by_age_dat$data)
```

#### Filter the data by all parameters

```{r}
# Filter the data on the following criteria:
#  (1) Year range of 2000 - 2018
#  (2) Both Genders
#  (3) Age Group of Under 25s
filtered_by_all_params_dat = filter(dat, start.year = 2000, end.year = 2018,
                                    gender = c("both"), age.group = c("under_25"))

# Notice that we a data point for the "under_25" age group and "both" gender
colnames(filtered_by_all_params_dat$data)

# The date range is 2000 - 2018
range(filtered_by_all_params_dat$data$year)
```

## Fit the Data

The `fit()` function fits various Spline models to the `livereg` data. The Spline models 
supported are B-Splines and Smoothing Splines. The `fit()` function fits the model based on the
following input parameters:

* __`spline.type`__ determines the Spline model to fit to the data. Choice between: "b" and "smoothing".
* __`num.knots`__ the number of knots in the Spline model. 
    * For Smoothing Splines the maximum number of knots is the maximum number of time points in the data.
    * For B-Splines the maximum number of knots is set at 10 and the knots themselves are the quantiles of the data.
* __`y.col`__ the data point to use when fitting the Spline model. If no value is specified then the first data point of the `livereg` data object is used.

The data object returned from the `fit()` function is the `livereg_fit` object. This object
contains the following information:

* All the data from the `livereg` object.
* __`spline.type`__ Spline model fitted to the data.
* __`predicted.values`__ contains predicted values from the Spline model.
* __`model`__ the Spline model details.
* __`model.fit`__ the Spline model fit values (AIC and BIC for B-Splines, Penalised Criterion for Smoothing Splines).
* __`y.col`__ the dependant data point used in the Spline model.
* __`num.knots`__ the number of knots used in the fitted Spline model.

A full summary of the `livereg_fit` object can be viewed using the `summary()` function.

#### Fit a B-Spline model to the data

```{r}
# Fit the following model to the data:
#  (1) B-Spline model
#  (2) With 10 knots
#  (3) To the "both.all" data point (Gender: both, Age Group: all)
fit_bs = fit(dat, spline.type = "b", num.knots = 10, y.col = "both.all")

# Model type
fit_bs$spline.type

# Number of knots used
fit_bs$num.knots

# Dependant variable
fit_bs$y.col

# Model fit
fit_bs$model.fit
```

#### Fit a Smoothing Spline model to the data

```{r}
# Fit the following model to the data:
#  (1) Smoothing Spline model
#  (2) With 100 knots
#  (3) To the "both.all" data point (Gender: both, Age Group: all)
fit_ss = fit(dat, spline.type = "smoothing", num.knots = 100, y.col = "both.all")

# Model type
fit_ss$spline.type

# Number of knots used
fit_ss$num.knots

# Dependant variable
fit_ss$y.col

# Model fit
fit_ss$model.fit
```

## Plot the Data

The `plot()` function plots the data from the `livereg_fit` object and then overlays the fitted
Spline model onto the data plot. The __`max.x.labels`__ input parameter controls the number of
'x' labels to display on the plot.

```{r fig.width=7, fig.align="center"}
# Fit a B-Spline model to the data
fit = fit(dat, spline.type = "b", num.knots = 10, y.col = "both.all")

# Plot the "both.all" data point and the fitted B-Spline model
plot(fit)
```

## Summary of the Fitted Data

The `summary()` function prints a summary of the basic statistics of the data and the Spline
model statistics of the `livereg_fit` object. No object is returned from the `summary()`
function as it doesn't enrich the `livereg_fit` object with any additional information.

```{r}
# Fit a B-Spline model to the data
fit = fit(dat, spline.type = "b", num.knots = 10, y.col = "both.all")

# Print a summary of the livereg_fit object
summary(fit)
```

## Shiny Application

The `liveregr` package also includes a Shiny application which uses all the functionality of
the package.

### Launch the Shiny application

The Shiny application is launched by running the `shiny_livereg()` function.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Launch the Shiny application
shiny_livereg()
```

When Shiny application is launched, the user will be presented with a screen that has the CSO
logo in the main panel and a "Data Loader" side panel. The "Data Loader" side panel loads the
data into the Shiny application once the following input selections have been made:

* Statistical Indicator: Raw Numbers or Seasonally Adjusted Numbers
* Data Source: Offline or the CSO StatBank API. __NOTE__ Offline is recommended for demo purposes.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/landing.png")
```

### Functionality

Once the data has been loaded into the Shiny application, the state of the application changes.
The main panel now loads a tabset panel with 3 tabs:

* Plot: A plot of the dataset with the Spline model overlayed on it.
* Table: A table of the dataset and the Spline model predicted values.
* Summary: Summary of the basic statistics and the Spline model statitics of the dataset.

The side panel now has an additional "Filter" panel. This filter panel allows the user to:

* Select the year range of the dataset.
* Gender of the dataset.
* Age Group of the dataset.

Under the plot is the "Spline Configuration" panel. The panel allows the user to:

* Select the Spline type.
* The number of knots to use in the Spline model fit.

All the input widgets change the plot, table and summary output widgets interactively.

#### Plot Tab

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/plot_tab.png")
```

#### Table Tab

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/table_tab.png")
```

#### Summary Tab

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/summary_tab.png")
```
